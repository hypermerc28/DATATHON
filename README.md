# Fresh Food Provisioning Forecast Model - Ryanair AirlinesðŸ¥—

## Description

This initiative aims to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast the quantity of fresh food required for each flight daily. The goal is to optimize fresh food allocation across flights in November 2023, enhancing customer satisfaction, increasing revenue, and supporting environmental sustainability by reducing waste.

## Model Used

**XG Boost Regressor**: Employed for its robustness and effectiveness in handling diverse datasets, this model allows us to predict fresh food needs with high accuracy, factoring in customer preferences, flight schedules, and other relevant data.

## Main Findings

- **High Sales Prediction Accuracy**: The model achieves high accuracy levels, enabling precise provisioning and minimal waste.
- **Customer Preference Patterns**: Distinct patterns in customer preferences related to flight specifics have been identified, aiding in targeted food offerings.
- **Optimization of waste**: Current strategies show potential for improvement in aligning food supply with demand to minimize both shortages and surplus.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Analysis**: Collection of historical sales data, customer feedback and flight information. Machine learning algorithms analyze patterns to forecast demand for fresh food per flight.
   
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Development of a predictive model to calculate needed fresh food quantities, integrating insights on customer buying behaviors.
   
3. **Strategic Implementation**: A dynamic allocation system based on model outputs optimizes the distribution of fresh food items across flights, adjustable in real-time based on the latest data.
   
4. **Monitoring & Optimization**: Continuous monitoring and refinement of the model and allocation system, utilizing feedback loops to adapt to market changes and customer needs.

## Strategic Recommendations

- **Dynamic Allocation System**: Implement systems that adjust food supplies dynamically to meet predicted demand, considering various influencing factors such as flight timing and seasonality.
- **Customer Feedback Loop**: Establish mechanisms to collect and analyze customer feedback on food offerings to continually refine prediction models and menu selections.
- **Waste Reduction Initiatives**: Collaborate with local organizations to redistribute excess fresh food, through reducing waste and enhancing community food security.

## Economic and Environmental Impact

- **Increased Revenue**: Proper alignment of food offerings with customer preferences is expected to boost sales revenue by 5-10%.
- **Cost Savings**: Optimizing food procurement and reducing waste could cut costs by approximately 3-5% of the total food provisioning budget.
- **Environmental Benefits**: Less food waste contributes to sustainability by lowering greenhouse gas emissions from food production, transport and decomposition.

## Conclusion

By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, the strategy optimizes fresh food provisioning in alignment with actual demand. Implementing these recommendations will not only yield significant economic benefits but also bolster environmental sustainability.
